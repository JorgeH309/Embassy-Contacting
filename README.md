This script works as a web scraper, essentially going through the US Department of State's travel website (https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/consularnotification/ConsularNotificationandAccess.html) and obtaining the emails of all foreign embassies found in the United States from their respective subpage. Web scraping is a slow process, so the script has been adjusted to place the obtained emails onto a text file the first time it is ran. As long as the text file is not deleted, the script will parse through that file for emails every other time. Inconsistencies were found in the page such as embassies being placed under the wrong country, so conditional statements have been placed throughout to counteract them.
